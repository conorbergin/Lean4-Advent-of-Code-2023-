# Lean4 Advent of Code 2023

I am learning Lean4, and AoC is my favourite way to get to grips with a new language.
Lean4 is a theorem prover with a dependant type system, that is also a general pupose 
programming language. Think of the dependant types as an alternative to writing tests.

These solutions are pure, I am storing my input.txt in a string called `input` 
and getting my results from the eval macro. This is comparable to the experience 
of using a speadsheet, or an Observable notebook,
but the delimitation is you own functions and definition, not cells.
